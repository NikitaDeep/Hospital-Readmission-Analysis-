Hospital Readmission Analysis & Prediction


Project Overview

Unplanned hospital readmissions are a major challenge for healthcare systems, driving up costs and reducing patient satisfaction. This project analyzes 101,766 patient encounters with 50 features (demographic, clinical, and medication-related variables) to identify risk factors and predict readmission likelihood.



Objectives

Identify patterns and drivers of hospital readmissions
Explore patient demographics, diagnoses, and discharge dispositions influencing outcomes
Develop predictive models to flag high-risk patients
Provide actionable insights for healthcare providers to reduce readmission rates



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key findings from the dataset:

Readmission Rate: 46.1% of patients were readmitted; 11.2% within 30 days
Age Impact: Lowest readmission in children (1.8%), highest in young adults (14.3%), and consistently high (11–12%) in patients above 60
Admission Source: Emergency room admissions had the highest readmission rate (~15.5%)
Diabetes Management: Patients with “up” or “down” changes in insulin usage showed higher readmissions (13–14%) vs steady usage (~10%)
Number of Diagnoses: Readmission risk increased sharply with multiple comorbidities (~27% at 11 diagnoses)
Discharge Disposition: Patients sent to skilled nursing facilities or home with healthcare support had higher readmissions (16–14.7%) compared to normal home discharge (~9.3%)



Predictive Modeling

Applied Logistic Regression using time_in_hospital and other features
Achieved ~88% accuracy, but with limitations (high accuracy from class imbalance, low recall for positive readmissions)
ROC-AUC score: 0.55 (room for model improvement with more features/advanced ML techniques)


Key Insights

High-risk groups: Young adults (20s), elderly (60+), patients with multiple diagnoses, unstable diabetes treatment, and those discharged to special care
Actionable Recommendations:
Enhance discharge planning & follow-ups for emergency admissions
Closely monitor diabetes patients with fluctuating insulin usage
Provide targeted post-discharge support for patients with multiple chronic conditions
